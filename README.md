## Plan!

Let's suppose we're working on a Node.js file called `movie-villains.js`.

We want to build this as a DB CRUD example.

```sh
node movie-villains.js help # Display available commands.
node movie-villains.js index # List all villains.
node movie-villains.js show <id> # Show specific villain.
node movie-villains.js edit <id> <name> <movie> # Replace name / movie for specific villain.
node movie-villains.js create <name> <movie> # Create a new villain.
node movie-villains.js delete <id> # Delete specific villain.
```
