## What are we building?

* Make a basic CRUD application for the terminal.

We'll want to map out which commands this app will accept:

```bash
node movie-villains.js help # Displays list of commands
node movie-villains.js index # Display all villains
node movie-villains.js show <id> # Display specific villain
node movie-villains.js update <id> <name> <movie> # Replace existing villain's info.
node movie-villains.js delete <id> # Remove specific villain from DB
node movie-villains.js create <name> <movie> # Add new villain!
```
